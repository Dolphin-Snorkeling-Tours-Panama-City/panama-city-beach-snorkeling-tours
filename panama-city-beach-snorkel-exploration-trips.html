<div><p>To receive a full refund, cancellations must be made 72 hours before departure for parties larger than 10.</p><p>A great way to get close to marine life is snorkeling. We'll show you how to use your snorkel gear comfortably and allow you to see the ocean floor through a mask. <i>Nature</i>  The expert and experienced guide will take you to the grassy shallows of Shell Island. You might see sea horses or sea stars in the shallows around Shell Island. You might have the opportunity to meet a wild bottlenose dolphin as you cruise over a coral reef looking for sea urchins or colorful tropical fish. You might also be able to find an uninhabited shell that you can bring home.</p><p>You will find some of the most beautiful beaches and snorkeling spots on Florida's coasts!
